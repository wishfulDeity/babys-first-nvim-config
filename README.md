# wishfulDeity's Silly Goofy Neovim Config

Most of the work was done using [MartinLwx's config](https://martinlwx.github.io/en/config-neovim-from-scratch/), but like, the version from some time in 2023 (whenever the initial commit to this repo was). So it uses packer insteaed of whatever they use now.
I just added some stuff to my own liking.

To be honest, I don't really know how Lua works. I copy-pasted at least 90% of the code here.

## Installation
### Linux
This will erase whatever is currently in `~/.config/nvim`
```bash
rm -rf ~/.config/nvim
git clone https://github.com/wishfulDeity/babys-first-nvim-config.git ~/.config/nvim
```
### Other operating systems
I'm gonna assume you can just kinda
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wishfulDeity/babys-first-nvim-config.git (/path/to/nvim/config)
```
But I wouldn't know
Good luck!!
