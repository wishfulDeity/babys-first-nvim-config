# wishfulDeity's Silly Goofy NeoVim Config

Most of the work was done using [MartinLwx's config](https://martinlwx.github.io/en/config-neovim-from-scratch/). 
I just added some stuff to my own liking.

To be honest, I don't really know how Lua works. I copy-pasted at least 99% of the code here.

## Installation
Dunno how this goes on Windows/MacOS, but to install on Linux, simply run this command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wishfulDeity/babys-first-nvim-config.git ~/.config/nvim
```
